      <p>I'm Billy! Many people refere to me as "Billy Nye", "Billy the Kid", and "Billiam", but I prefer Billy. I was born in California, but raised in Ocala, FL and eventually move to the city of Orlando to broaden my horizons. I'm 22 years old and extremely charming.</p>
      <p>I gained an interest in coding when I was approximately 12 years old and wanted to make my MySpace sparkly, so I looked up how to do it. Since then I have been dabbling in it for personal things, but I have now decided to make it into a career because I rather do enjoy it. I will be using this website as my skills and portfolio develop.</p>
